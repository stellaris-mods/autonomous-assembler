The ships are configured with a public key prior to launch, which is used to verify the signature of incoming configuration data. Given the huge expanses of our colonized space, there is no way we could do request-response cycles to differentiate between ships, or mathematically verify time signatures without setting an unreasonable timeout, which means that we broadcast the same settings in a wide-spectrum wavelength, and let all ships receive the same configuration. Of course, since they are equipped with different expansion cards, they might act upon the information - once verified - in different ways depending on local configuration."
