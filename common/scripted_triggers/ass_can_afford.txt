# FLEET contains these variables:
# AssMissionCost, the total mineral cost of the current target operation
# AssReserve, how many minerals the country wants to reserve
# AssMinerals, how many minerals the country has in total
#
# Whether we can afford an operation depends on if
# AssMinerals > (AssReserve + AssMissionCost)
#
# Before using ass_can_afford, make sure you run ass_update_total_cost
# on the ship, which sums the above calculation to AssMinimum.
#

ass_can_afford = {
	fleet = {
		check_variable = { which = "AssMinerals" value > "AssMinimum" }
	}
