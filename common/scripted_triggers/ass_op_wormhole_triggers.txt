# Medium: You've been there before, but currently have no sensors on it

# Low: Everything else
# low = know whether a system is inside borders of empires with comms
# low= you know the planet positions
# Low level intel just means that you haven't had that system in sensor range, whether it's named or not.
# unknown = you only know there is a star
# surveyed or not doesnt matter for this, surveyed is white system name and not surveyed is grey name
