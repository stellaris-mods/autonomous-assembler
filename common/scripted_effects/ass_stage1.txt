# Stages
# 1: Initialization, target selection and relation mapping
#    - In all stage 1 effects, ROOT must be the ship.
#
# 2: En route to target
# 3: At target
# 4: Operation complete



# This is only invoked by assShip.1, which is only triggered by
# on_ship_built or by MTTH after checking ass_has_operation and is_fleet_idle,
# and in both cases the ship should be entirely idle.
# It's also invoked by the special project to dock at a colony.
#
# The main thing to note is that ROOT in this effect must be the ship.
