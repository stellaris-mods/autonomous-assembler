# Alphas Spaceport addon ("Spaceport (1.x)")
#
# These effects have _nothing_ to do with AlphaModPlus, which simply extends
# the number of slots on the spaceport.
#
# These are for his mod that add new module types.
# The reason we add empty effects here is to prevent error.log output if the
# Spaceport addon is NOT loaded. The reason we CAN do it, is because Spaceport
# loads _after_ Autonomous Assembler, which means that Spaceport
# overrides these effect in a file with a _different_ name than this one.
#
# And also the file must load after this filename in natural sort order.
